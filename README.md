# OntoGen
A command-line software called **OntoGen** for analysis and transformation of source spreadsheet data to ontology.

## Version

1.1

## Preliminaries

A source (input) spreadsheet represents a set of same type entities in a relational form (a subset of the Cartesian product of *K*-data domains), where:
1.	*Attribute (a column name)* is a name of a data domain in a relationship schema;
2.	*Metadata (a schema)* is an ordered set of *K*-attributes of a relational table;
3.	*Tuple (a record)* is an ordered set of *K*-atomic values (one for each attribute of a relation);
4.	*Data (a recordset)* is a set of tuples of a relational table.

A spreadsheet of same type entities (*a canonicalized form*) is a relational table in the third normal form (3NF), which contains an ordered set of *N*-rows and *M*-columns.

A table represents a set of entities of the same type, where:
1.	*Categorical column or Named entities column (NE-column)* contains names (text mentions) of some named entities;
2.	*Literal column (L-column)* contains literal values (e.g. dates, numbers);
3.	*Subject (thematic) column (S-column)* is a *NE*-column represented as a potential primary key and defines a subject of a source table;
4.	*Another (non-subject) columns* represent entity properties including their relationships with other entities;

**Assumption 1.** *The first row of a source spreadsheet is a header containing attribute (column) names.*

**Assumption 2.** *All values of column cells in a source spreadsheet have same entity types and data types.*

**Assumption 3.** *Source spreadsheets should be presented in the CSV format.*

**OntoGen** supports the process of ontology engineering based on spreadsheet data transformation.

**Assumption 4.** *A target ontology is presented in the [OWL2 DL](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/) format.*

## Installation

First, you need to clone the project into your directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/Lab42-Team/ontogen.git
